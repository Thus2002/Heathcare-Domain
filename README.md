# Heathcare-Domain

## Project Overview
This mini project is based on the **Healthcare Domain** and uses **Machine Learning classification** to predict whether a patient has a disease or not based on medical parameters such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol, BMI, and glucose level.

The project demonstrates the complete ML workflow:
- Data loading
- Preprocessing
- Model training
- Evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrix
- Disease prediction for a new patient

---

## Problem Statement
To classify patients into:
- **Disease Present (1)**
- **No Disease (0)**

using supervised machine learning techniques.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:**
  - pandas
  - scikit-learn
- **ML Algorithm:** Logistic Regression  
- **IDE:** VS Code / Jupyter Notebook
